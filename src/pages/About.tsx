              <p className="text-gray-700">
              YeboPets is a fresh startup built by youth, for youth. We're just getting started, but our mission is bold â€” to empower young people in South Africa by creating simple, local job opportunities like dog walking and pet-sitting.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
              YeboPets was founded in 2025 by Robert Kanegamba and Daniel Kassy, two driven students and lifelong animal lovers. They envisioned a pet care service that not only provided excellent care for animals but also created a new path for young people to earn passive income while still in high school - all while treating pets with the same love and respect their owners do.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Our name combines "Yebo" (meaning "yes" in Zulu) with "Pets" to reflect our positive, affirming approach to pet care and our South African roots.
